			<p>Historically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt,
				which held
				the position for over 3,800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. The
				Strasbourg
				Cathedral in France, completed in 1439, was the world's tallest building until 1874.</p>
			<p>
				The first skyscraper was pioneered in Chicago with the 138 ft (42.1 m) Home Insurance Building
				in 1885. The
				United States would hold the position of the world's tallest building throughout the 20th
				century until
				1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then, two other buildings have gained the
				title: Taipei
				101 in 2004 and Burj Khalifa in 2010. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the Middle East,
				China,
				and Southeast Asia have experienced booms in skyscraper construction.</p>

		<hr>
		<p>The international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in
			1969 and announces the title of "The World's Tallest Building" and sets the standards by which buildings are
			measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.[6] The organization
			currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828 m (2,717 ft). However, the CTBUH only
			recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not
			considered finished by the CTBUH.</p>

		<p>In 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller,[7] the
			council listed and ranked buildings in four categories: </p>
		
		<ul id="list-of-criterias">
			<li>height to structural or architectural top</li>
			<li>height to floor of highest occupied floor</li>
			<li>height to top of roof (removed as category in November 2009)</li>
			<li>height to top of any part of the building.</li>
		</ul>
